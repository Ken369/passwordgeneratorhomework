# Password Generator Homework

This homework was submitted on:
```
 Wednesday 4/3/20
```
The criteria was to submit the following:
```
* 8-128 Characters
* Lowercase
* Uppercase
* Numeric
* Symbols
```


Styling was included and I made sure the UI was visually appealing

1. I didnt have a error msg for the number entry if there was nothing ticked. I didnt know how to write this in JS so instead I wrote it in text.

2. The list wasnt responsive so I added a scroll feature for passwords with a long character length
